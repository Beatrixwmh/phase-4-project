# Classification of tweets based on sentiment 
## Project Overview
In this project, I built a classification model to analyse tweets regarding different technological products in order to identify the sentiment expressed in them. To do so, I used natural language processing tools and experimented wtih different classifcation algorithms in an attempt to yield the best result. First, I took in large amounts of data about past tweets and experimented with different ways of preprocessing, then I built models that analyse the relationhsip betweem various characteristics of the text and the sentiment expressed such that it can identify the sentimnet of a given tweet. I iteratively modified on the features of the training data based on the results of the previous model until I arrived at a final model. 
## Business Problem
I am working with the advertising team of twitter, who works with various comapnies interested in curating advertisements of their products directed at twitter users. My goal is to build a model that can identify the sentiment expressed in a given tweet in order inform clients of what twitter users like and dislike about their products such that they can create better advertisements to promote their products. <br/>
In other words, I need a model that can accurately classify tweets such that twitter would be able to sort the tweets by postive or negative sentiments, and inform their clients about what users think about thier products. Since the goal is to help clients with advertising, in which the positive aspects of the product is emphasized, I will prioritize identifying postive sentiments.
## The Data
The data I will be using to train the model is from data.world, which contains almost 10,000 tweets that are labelled with their respective sentiments and product towards which the tweet was directed. There were three categories of sentiments: positve, negative, neutral, and unknown. Since the goal is to identify the sentiment, I dropped the 'unknown' entires as they would not provide useful information, and I focused on the columns containing the text and the sentiment since I want the model to be generalizable to tweets about products not included in the database.
## Methods
There were a lot of decisions to be made about how to preprocess the data. I started off simple with just taking into account the most common words in each category and created a baseline model based on that. To give a better guage of the kind of database I am working with, here are the graphs showing the distributions of the 10 most common words in tweets of each of the three categories, which is what my baseline model took into account. <br/>

As apparent above, there were a lot of words they shared in common, which is not useful in helping the model differentiate between the three sentiments. I then tried removing words that were common to all three categories and added more features, like reducing every word to thier basic form and looking at the most common pairs of words in each category, viasaulizing the distrubtions and testing my new set of features with a new model every time to see if there was any improvement. <br/>
After many rounds of experimentation, I ended up with a set of features that encompasses infomration like the 500 most common single words and pairs of words respectively, and also the number of exclaimation marks in each tweet. <br/>
Moreover, since the data has very strong class imbalance, with roughly 60% of tweets being neutral, 30% being postitive, and only 6 % being negative, I used oversampling, which is a tool that repeatedly samples data from the minority classes randomly such that the model would learn more about the patterns in the minority class to better able to identify them. Moreover, since identifying postiive sentiment is more important than identifying the other two sentiments for the purposes of advertising, I ended up combining neutral and negative classes together and made a binary classification model in order to improve its accuracy.
